# Telcom-Churn-Prediction

Churn is a great problem in the telecommunication industry. The percentage of customers leaving is almost 2% a month in the US. In this project we analyze data to see if we can get any useful insight for one of these companies, that is our client. We also apply some machine learning technique to see if we can predict who is gonna leave with an acceptable accuracy.
